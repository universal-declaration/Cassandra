# Economic Impact Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Cassandra Amendment would cost approximately $550 million annually (0.01% of federal revenue) while potentially preventing crises that have historically cost tens of trillions. Even preventing one medium-scale crisis per decade would yield a 100:1 return on investment.

## Conclusion

The Cassandra Amendment represents one of the highest-return investments available to the United States. At a cost of less than 0.01% of federal spending, it could prevent losses measured in tens of trillions while improving government efficiency, economic planning, and international competitiveness.

Even under the most pessimistic assumptions, the amendment pays for itself many times over. Under realistic scenarios, it offers returns that dwarf any other public investment. The economic case is compelling: the cost of continuing to ignore long-term risks far exceeds the modest investment in institutional foresight.

**Bottom Line**: Spend $550 million annually to save $950 billion annually - a 1,700:1 return on investment.
